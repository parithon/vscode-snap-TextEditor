# Snap Text Editor

This extension will allow you to snap the text editor (instead of split them). What does "snap" mean? VS Code's Split command will open a copy of the text editor to whichever direction you choose (up/down/left/right). However, once that text editor is opened it does not close the original text editor. This extension seeks to solve this problem.
